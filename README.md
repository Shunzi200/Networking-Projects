# Networking Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating basic networking concepts and implementations. Each script serves as a standalone project showcasing different aspects of network programming, from simple HTTP server operations to simulating TCP functionality over a lossy network.

## Projects Overview

### `curl-clone`
A simplified version of the `curl` tool, designed for fetching web resources using HTTP GET requests. It showcases basic network programming concepts, handling of HTTP protocols, and response parsing.

### `TCP`
Implements a basic version of TCP over a simulated lossy network environment, demonstrating reliable data transmission, packet sequencing, acknowledgments, and handling of network unreliabilities.

### `http_server`
A basic HTTP server capable of handling GET requests and serving static HTML content. It illustrates how to set up a server, manage incoming connections, and serve web content based on request paths.
